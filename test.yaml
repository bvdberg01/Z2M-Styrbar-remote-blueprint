  name: Z2M - IKEA five button remote for lights
  description: |
    Control lights with an IKEA five button remote (the round ones).

    The middle "on" button, toggle the lights on/off to the last set brightness
    (unless the force brightness is toggled on in the blueprint).

    Dim up/down buttons will change the brightness smoothly and can be pressed
    and hold until the brightness is satisfactory.

    The "left" and "right" buttons can be assigned to a short and long button
    press action. This allows you to assign, e.g., a scene or anything else.

    This is a fork of @Frenck's blueprint for ZHA found here https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-ikea-five-button-remote-for-lights/253804
